# NOTE1
This repository is a Cache Simulator with write-back and write-allocate strategy.\
I will implement direct mapping cache, fully associative cache and set associative cache. \
When it comes to set associative cache, I'll implement LRU, LFU and randomized replacing strategy.

# NOTE2
all the trace files are generated by 'valgrind' (a unix tool)\
and we just care about operation READ('L' for data loading) and \
WRITE('M' for data modifying, 'S' for data storing). \
Supposing all memory accessing has already aligned.
