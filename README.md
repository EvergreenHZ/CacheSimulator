# NOTE1
This repository is a Cache Simulator with write-back and write-allocate strategy.I will implement direct mapping cache, fully associative cache and set associative cache. When it comes to set associative cache, I'll implement LRU, LFU and randomized replacing strategy.

# NOTE2
all the trace files are generated by 'valgrind' (a unix tool)and we just care about operation READ('L' for data loading) and \
WRITE('M' for data modifying, 'S' for data storing). Supposing all memory accessing has already aligned.

# NOTE3
Read opeation(R, W) and address from trace file and pass them to accessCache(...)
First, find the corresponding set.

## DIRECT MAPPING
check tag_existence and valid
if tag_existence:
        if valid:
                HIT
        if not valid:
                COLD_MISS
                load data from memory to cache
if not tag_existence:
        if valid:  # pay attention, now valid means current cache line is used
                check the whole cache is full of not
                if full:
                        CAPACITY_MISS
                if not full:
                        CONFLICT_MISS
                evict current cache line and load the new data
        if not valid:  # COLD_MISS
                COLD_MISS
                load data from memory to cache

## FULLY ASSOCIATIVE
check tag_existence and valid
if tag_existence:
        if valid:
                HIT
        if not valid:
                COLD_MISS
                find an empty line and load data
if not tag_existence:
        if valid:  # the whole cache is full
                CAPACITY_MISS
                find a random cache line and load data(random replacement policy)
        if not valid:  # the whole cache is not full
                COLD_MISS
                find an empty cache line and load the data

## SET ASSOCIATIVE
check tag_existence and valid
### FOR LRU POLICY
        if tag_existence:
                if valid:
                        HIT
                        update the stamp of the hitted cache line
                if not valid:
                        COLD_MISS
                        load data to cache
        if not tag_existence:
                if valid:  # current cache lines are full
                        check the whole cache is full or not
                        if full:
                                CAPACITY_MISS
                                find a victim cache line with minimum time stamp and replace it
                        if not full:
                                CONFLICT_MISS
                                find a victim cache line with minimum time stamp and replace it
                if not valid:
                        COLD_MISS
                        load data to cache

### FOR LFU POLICY
        if tag_existence:
                if valid:
                        HIT
                        increase the access count of the hitted cache line
                if not valid:
                        COLD_MISS
                        load data to cache
        if not tag_existence:
                if valid:  # current cache lines are full
                        check the whole cache is full or not
                        if full:
                                CAPACITY_MISS
                                find a victim cache line with minimum access count and replace it
                        if not full:
                                CONFLICT_MISS
                                find a victim cache line with minimum access count and replace it
                if not valid:
                        COLD_MISS
                        load data to cache
